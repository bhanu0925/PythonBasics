1. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me. Then, write the conditional tests (if, else, and elif) to
print the string &#39;too low&#39; if guess_me is less than 7, &#39;too high&#39; if greater than 7, and &#39;just right&#39; if equal
to 7.
2. Assign the value 7 to the variable guess_me and the value 1 to the variable start. Write a while
loop that compares start with guess_me. Print too low if start is less than guess me. If start equals
guess_me, print &#39;found it!&#39; and exit the loop. If start is greater than guess_me, print &#39;oops&#39; and exit
the loop. Increment start at the end of the loop.
3. Print the following values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0] using a for loop.
4. Use a list comprehension to make a list of the even numbers in range(10)
5. Use a dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary squares. Use range(10) to return the
keys, and use the square of each key as its value.
6. Construct the set odd from the odd numbers in the range using a set comprehension (10).
7. Use a generator comprehension to return the string &#39;Got &#39; and a number for the numbers in
range(10). Iterate through this by using a for loop.
8. Define a function called good that returns the list [&#39;Harry&#39;, &#39;Ron&#39;, &#39;Hermione&#39;].
9. Define a generator function called get_odds that returns the odd numbers from range(10). Use a
for loop to find and print the third value returned.
10. Define an exception called OopsException. Raise this exception to see what happens. Then write
the code to catch this exception and print &#39;Caught an oops&#39;.
11. Use zip() to make a dictionary called movies that pairs these lists: titles = [&#39;Creature of Habit&#39;,
&#39;Crewel Fate&#39;] and plots = [&#39;A nun turns into a monster&#39;, &#39;A haunted yarn shop&#39;].

1. Create a zoo.py file first. Define the hours() function, which prints the string &#39;Open 9-5 daily&#39;.
Then, use the interactive interpreter to import the zoo module and call its hours() function.
2. In the interactive interpreter, import the zoo module as menagerie and call its hours() function.
3. Using the interpreter, explicitly import and call the hours() function from zoo.
4. Import the hours() function as info and call it.
5. Create a plain dictionary with the key-value pairs &#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2, and &#39;c&#39;: 3, and print it out.
6.Make an OrderedDict called fancy from the same pairs listed in 5 and print it. Did it print in the
same order as plain?
7. Make a default dictionary called dict_of_lists and pass it the argument list. Make the list
dict_of_lists[&#39;a&#39;] and append the value &#39;something for a&#39; to it in one assignment. Print
dict_of_lists[&#39;a&#39;].
